# BIT Index Tabula: Drafts

**Official Journal of the [BIThub Community](https://hub.bitwiki.org/)**
The *BIT Index Tabula* serves as the formal publication platform for the BITcore community, advancing research in systems theory, recursive modeling, and structural logic.

> ## Objectives:
> 1. > Disseminate rigorously reviewed, high-impact research.
> 2. > Establish BIT Index as a leading center for systems-based knowledge.
> 3. > Ensure methodological integrity in all contributions.

# Submmission Guide - TBA
> - Manuscripts must align with the journalâ€™s scope and structure
> - Work must be original, unpublished, and methodologically sound
> - Adhere to official formatting and citation rules
> - To start you must first be a part of the [BIT Hub](http://hub.bitwiki.org/) find more information on submitting here.

> ### Submmission Flow
> 1 [Pull Request with Paper under main.tex organized in its respective folders] --> 2 [Review by Our Team and Community] --> 3 [Comments and Return or Submission]
>
> Submit Papers in Latex as main.tex and they auto-compile using Github actions into PDFs.
